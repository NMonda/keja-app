### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a smart real estate platform that will simplify the process of house hunting and selling for both buyers and sellers. The current process of buying or selling a house is often time-consuming and complex, requiring multiple visits to properties, lengthy negotiations, and paperwork. The smart real estate platform aims to streamline this process and provide an efficient and user-friendly solution.

The goals of the project are to:

Provide a comprehensive database of properties for sale or rent that is easily searchable by location, price, and features.

Enable buyers to schedule virtual property tours, reducing the need for physical visits and saving time.

Provide an automated property valuation tool that will give sellers a fair and accurate estimate of the value of their property.

Allow buyers and sellers to communicate directly through the platform, simplifying the negotiation process and reducing the need for intermediaries.

Provide secure and efficient online documentation and payment options, reducing the need for physical paperwork.
